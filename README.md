# Course Modules Usage Statistics
This is a modified version of Modules Usage Statistics plugin for Moodle 2.7+. You can find it here: https://moodle.org/plugins/view.php?plugin=modstats

In this version you can see the number of the uploaded modules in a category broken down by courses.

The checkbox is writing a file database in minidb.json. In the code you use the json file as an associative array!


## Releases
- v1.0: this is the first version of the plugin.
- v2.0: in this version you can click on the coursename to see the course itself. 
You can use a checkbox to give yourself a feedback about review status of the course.
